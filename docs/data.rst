Public Data
===========

Reflectance spectra of asteroids may vary due to observational circumanstances,
differences in data processing, and physical processes on the minor body. It is
generally worthwhile to compare spectral observations of individual asteroids
reported by different surveys. ``classy`` sources the databases listed
alphabetically below to allow for quick comparisons between literature data and
your observations.\ [#f1]_

You can download and visualize a spectrum using the command line via the ``$
classy spectra`` command. The ``python`` interface allows more advanced
analyses and access to the metadata. Examples are given for each data
collection below.

.. [#f1] Completeness is important. If there is a public online repository of
   spectra you would like to see inlcuded, please `suggest it
   <https://github.com/maxmahlke/classy/issues>`_ and it will be added if
   possible.
