Abstract:
    We present a new iteration of the asteroid taxonomy from a clustering
    analysis of spectroscopic observations and visual albedos of asteroids in
    the Main Belt and near-Earth space. The classes are defined using a
    concurrent dimensionality-reduction and Gaussian-clustering approach. By
    re-introducing the visual albedo into the observables used to classify
    asteroids, we dis- entangle the X-complex into the E, M, and P classes. We
    further identify a new class Z of extremely-red objects in the Main Belt.

Description:
    Provided are the preprocessed spectra and visual albedos for the samples in
    the visible-near-infrared dataset and the visible-only dataset. For each
    sample, we further give the probability to belong to any of the 50 Gaussian
    clusters and 16 classes (Class Ch does not have a probability) and the
    latent scores. The depth, centers, and signal-to-noise ratios of the e, h,
    and k features and the final classifications per sample and asteroid are
    provided as well. This data is aggregated into a single classification per
    asteroid in a separate file. Further provided are the mean
    visible-near-infrared spectrum and visual albedo per taxonomic class as
    defined in Mahlke+ 2022. The moments were defined based on all asteroid
    samples which were assigned to the respective class. The first column
    (feature) gives the wavelength bins of the spectra as well as the visual
    albedo (pV) in the last row. The mean values of the 17 classes follow in
    the next column. The spectra are normalized to unity at 0.55micron. Further
    provided are the upper and lower standard deviation for the spectra and
    albedos per class, given in the respective '_upper' and '_lower' columns
    following the mean columns. Finally, there are two tables containing the
    keys for the bibliographic references of the spectra and visual albedos.
